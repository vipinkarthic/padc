## Thread Safety Considerations

### Critical Sections

- BFS initialization: Protected with `#pragma omp critical`
- Result merging: Protected with `#pragma omp critical`
- All other operations: Thread-safe by design

### Data Dependencies

- **Independent**: All grid cell computations
- **No race conditions**: Each thread works on separate memory regions
- **Synchronization**: Minimal critical sections only where necessary

## Compilation Requirements

### OpenMP Support

```bash
# GCC/Clang
g++ -fopenmp -O3 biome_classifier.cpp

# MSVC
cl /openmp /O2 biome_classifier.cpp
```

### Recommended Flags

- `-O3` or `/O2`: Aggressive optimization
- `-march=native`: CPU-specific optimizations
- `-fopenmp` or `/openmp`: OpenMP support

## Testing Recommendations

### Performance Testing

1. **Baseline**: Measure sequential performance
2. **Scaling**: Test with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
3. **Grid sizes**: Test with 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048
4. **Memory**: Monitor memory usage and cache misses

### Correctness Testing

1. **Output verification**: Ensure parallel results match sequential
2. **Edge cases**: Test with small grids, single-threaded execution
3. **Boundary conditions**: Verify edge handling in parallel loops

## Future Optimization Opportunities
